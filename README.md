# Arduino-DC-Motor-Control-Project-using-L293D

This project demonstrates how to control two DC motors using an Arduino UNO and an L293D motor driver IC. The motors perform a timed sequence of movements: forward, backward, and alternating left/right turns. The enable pins are driven using analogWrite() for full-speed control.

# Objectives

- Move forward for 30 seconds

- Move backward for 60 seconds

- Alternate between left and right every second for 1 minute

- Stop both motors
